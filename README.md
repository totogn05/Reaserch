Research on Identifying Oak Species through GLCM with CNN
As the most common object, wood has different effects in various industries. 
Today's wood identification is fully automated by computer. The focus of identification is mainly the shape and color of wood, 
but many woods cannot be effectively identified by color.  Different woods have similar colors but different textures. 
For example, although oak and cypress have the same color, oak is easy to obtain and durable and suitable for building materials or floors, and cypress is more suitable for its hardness and pattern.  
For furniture use, the use of wood with the same color but different textures will be very different. 
If it is wrong, it will cause various dangers. Therefore, I want to study a method that can effectively and quickly identify wood without using color as a basis, and has high accuracy.
